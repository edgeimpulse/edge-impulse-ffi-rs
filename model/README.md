# Model Folder

This folder is where the C++ code for your Edge Impulse model should go.

- The contents of this folder are managed by the build system and may be overwritten when you update or deploy a new model.
- Do **not** edit the files in this folder manually.
- To update the model, re-export your Edge Impulse project as a C++ library and copy the contents here, or use the automated build process.
